# supervised-machine-learning-challenge


This project contains an exercise for supervised Machine Learning.
In the project, I compared using a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Classifier to see which would perform best.

I predicted that the Random Forests Classifier will perform better because it is a more complex model than Logistic Regression.

Despite the Random Forest Classifier being more complex and taking significantly longer, the scores are very similar to the Logistic Regression. The Random Forest performed better with the training, but Logistic Regression outperformed by a marginal amount in the testing score. My original prediction was technically incorrect. However, since both models are giving a score over 99%, both can be reliably used for this data.
